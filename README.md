# NextPolish
NextPolish is used to fix base errors (SNV/Indel) in the genome generated by noisy long reads, it can be used with short read data only or long read data only or a combination of both. It contains two core modules, and use a stepwise fashion to correct the error bases in reference genome. To correct/assemble the raw third-generation sequencing (TGS) long reads with approximately 10-15% sequencing errors, please use [NextDenovo](https://github.com/Nextomics/NextDenovo).
