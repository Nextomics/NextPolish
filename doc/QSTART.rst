==========
NextPolish
==========

NextPolish is used to fix base errors (SNV/Indel) in the genome generated by noisy long reads, it can be used with short read data only or long read data only or a combination of both. It contains two core modules, and use a stepwise fashion to correct the error bases in reference genome. To correct the raw third-generation sequencing (TGS) long reads with approximately 10-15% sequencing errors, please use `NextDenovo <https://github.com/Nextomics/NextDenovo>`__.

Quick Start
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Prepare sgs\_fofn
   
   .. code-block:: shell

      ls reads1_R1.fq reads1_R2.fq reads2_R1.fq reads2_R2.fq > sgs.fofn

#. Create run.cfg
   
   .. code-block:: shell

      genome=input.genome.fa
      echo -e "task = best\ngenome = $genome\nsgs_fofn = sgs.fofn" > run.cfg

#. Run
   
   .. code-block:: shell

      nextPolish run.cfg

#. Finally polished genome

.. tip:: You can also use your own alignment pipeline, and then only use NextPolish to polish the genome, which will be faster than the default pipeline when runing on a local system. The accuracy of the polished genome is the same as the default. See following for an example (using bwa to do alignment).
      
   .. code-block:: shell

      #Set input and parameters
      round=2
      threads=20
      read1=reads_R1.fastq.gz
      read2=reads_R2.fastq.gz
      input=input.genome.fa
      for ((i=1; i<=${round};i++)); do
      #step 1:
         #index the genome file and do alignment
         bwa index ${input};
         bwa mem -t ${threads} ${input} ${read1} ${read2}|samtools view --threads 3 -F 0x4 -b -|samtools fixmate -m --threads 3  - -|samtools sort -m 2g --threads 5 -|samtools markdup --threads 5 -r - sgs.sort.bam
         #index bam and genome files
         samtools index -@ ${threads} sgs.sort.bam;
         samtools faidx ${input};
         #polish genome file
         python NextPolish/lib/nextpolish1.py -g ${input} -t 1 -p ${threads} -s sgs.sort.bam > genome.polishtemp.fa;
         input=genome.polishtemp.fa;
      #step2:
         #index genome file and do alignment
         bwa index ${input};
         bwa mem -t ${threads} ${input} ${read1} ${read2}|samtools view --threads 3 -F 0x4 -b -|samtools fixmate -m --threads 3  - -|samtools sort -m 2g --threads 5 -|samtools markdup --threads 5 -r - sgs.sort.bam
         #index bam and genome files
         samtools index -@ ${threads} sgs.sort.bam;
         samtools faidx ${input};
         #polish genome file
         python NextPolish/lib/nextpolish1.py -g ${input} -t 2 -p ${threads} -s sgs.sort.bam > genome.nextpolish.fa;
         input=genome.nextpolish.fa;
      done;
      #Finally polished genome file: genome.nextpolish.fa         

.. note:: It is recommend to use long reads to polish the raw genome (set ``task`` start with "5" and ``lgs_fofn`` or use `racon <https://github.com/isovic/racon>`__) before polishing with short reads to avoid incorrect mapping of short reads in some high error rate regions, especially for the assembly generated without a consensus step, such as `miniasm <https://github.com/lh3/miniasm>`__.
